# Simple-Portfolio
This is a simple portfolio containing most of my school work & homelabs! <br />

Even though most of my projects have their own separate repositories 
this is just a place where I have them all together for ease of access.<br />

I will do my best to keep this repository updated 
by adding everything I work on at least once every 6 months.<br />
